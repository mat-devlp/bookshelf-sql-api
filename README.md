# üìö BOOKSHELF
### PostgreSQL + External API Integration

## üöÄ Overview
Bookshelf is a project that allows you to maintain a collection of books stored in a PostgreSQL database. When a book is added by name, an external API is used to retrieve its cover image.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookshelf-sql-api.git
cd bookshelf-sql-api
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
```sh
npm i
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set up PostgreSQL database
Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a database named `bookshelf` and run the following SQL command to create the necessary table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    isbn TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    book_cover TEXT
);
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure database connection
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your PostgreSQL credentials:

```
  user: "postgres",
  host: "localhost",
  database: "[SERVER NAME]",
  password: "[YOUR PASSWORD]",
  port: 5432,
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bookshelf System
Start the application using Nodemon:
```sh
npm install -g nodemon  # Install nodemon globally if you haven't
nodemon index.js
```

Your application should now be running and able to store book information retrieved from an external API.

## üì° Features
- Add books by name, automatically fetching and storing the book cover.
- Retrieve the list of stored books.
